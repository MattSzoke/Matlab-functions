# Matlab-functions
This repository includes the following type of Matlab functions
- wrapper functions for frequency domain calculations (FFT, PSD, CPSD, coherence, etc.)
- Data loading functions from a series of data acquisition hardware (B&K PULSE, HBM, etc)
- Boundary layer processing functions (find boundary layer parameters such as thickness, momentum thickness, displacement thickness, friction velocity)
